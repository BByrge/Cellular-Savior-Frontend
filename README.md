# Cellular Savior Frontend

**[CellularSavior.com](https://cellularsavior.com)** is a web application designed to help users find the best cellular plan for their needs. By allowing users to compare plans, review detailed information, and receive personalized recommendations based on usage, **Cellular Savior** ultimately aims to provide a **trusted third-party** platform for both consumers and sales representatives to discuss **optimal cellular plans** with **transparency**.

Having worked in cellular sales for five years, I've seen firsthand how people are often taken advantage ofâ€”unnecessary fees, overpriced plans, and hidden contract terms are commonplace. **Cellular Savior** seeks to change that. Our goal is to **empower** individuals to make **informed decisions** while helping sales reps align with **honest sales practices**, cutting through the opacity and deceptive tactics that plague the market.

The application is built with Vue.js, Flask, and Google Cloud Platform (GAE, Datastore, OAuth 2.0).
